Pegasus-III: Solenoid-Free Startup in the Pegasus-III Experiment
S.J. Diem on January 28, 2025

- got funding to build the Pegasus-III experiment before going to UW-Madison
- part of the new science branch for the us, advises gov't about advancements in science and technology
- 20% energy into the alpha particle to reheat the plasma
- triple product for fusion: density, temperature, time
- on the order of 100-200 MK
- methods of fusion: lasers, gravity, magnets
- NIF reached the ignition point in December 2022
- charged particles naturally gyrate around magnetic field lines
- hot plasmas do not give off light unless they are recombining
- balance between engineering simplicity and difficulty from physics
- approaches to magnetic fusion
  - magnetic mirror: very simple
  - tokamak: torus that has some stabilities as field lines are not perfectly circular
  - stellerator: design follows the magnetic field lines perferctly
- challenges for fusion energy
  - sustain a burning plasma
  - develop more resistant material
  - better magnets
- need external heating to get the plasma up to temperature
  - neutral beams: shooting a beam of hot particles into the plasma. does not work for large reactors
  - ohmic heating: resistive heating
  - RF power: use microwaves or radio-waves to heat the plasma
- she works on RF power
- capacitors that store 175 MVA
- they use plasma injectors
- magnetic reconnection: getting ripping of magnetic field lines and the particles that were previously trapped in the field have the energy of the field imparted on them
- plasma wobbles because the stream of plasma rip
- injectors are very compact
- w/ injectors, there is a bulk plasma and a periphery of sparsely populated streams
- looking at if the injectors can fix the instabilities in the plasma
- temperature peaks at the edges because of impurities
- also looking at the plasma emission to understand impurities and radiated power
- US focused on building fusion pilot plant in the 2040s
- she is most excited about microwave heating
- main challenges with fusion
  - superconductors
  - materials
  - funding
  - tritium breeding
- optimistic timeline ~15 years for first commercial fusion power plant
- it would cost 2x the GDP to replace all of the generation capacity in the US
- 100~150 years to get to 20% of the generation capacity
- to get through the "valley of death," solar had to put in $100B/year and there is not nearly as much funding for fusion
