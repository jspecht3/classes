The State and Future of Nuclear Power, Policy
Katy Huff, 3/4/2023

- she was the assistant secretary of nuclear energy
- ran the office of nuclear energy
- does modeling for advanced reactors for research
- nuclear policy is kinda like a supercritical reaction
  - NEICA, MEIMA
  - MELA
  - ARDP
  - save Diablo Canyon
  - IIJA, IRA
  - COP28, multiple countries have dedicated to tripling nuclear by 2050
  - new nuclear is needed now
- same thing with nuclear energy social medea
- and nuclear enery startup
  - NuScale
  - Oklo, Tap
  - dozens of them
- and nuclear energy activism
  - nuclear science week
  - overturn moratoria
  - save diablo canyon
  - mascots, art, card game
  - NGOs, marches, sit-ins
  - COP, G20, Climate Week, Nuclear Energy Summit
- number of operating us reactors
  - 93 when she started at DOE
  - 94 now
- total number of nuclear reactors peaked in ~1990 and decreased until 2021
- us has the most reactors built, most reactors attempted, most reactors operating
  - china is making a bunch more reactors than us
  - us thought china had 24 under construction in 2024, but they really had 32
- trends to look out for to predict nuclear energy increasing
  - financing appetite
    - AP1000 is the only nuclear reactor design that has been exported
    - BofA, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman back nuclear power plants
  - change in development financing is lagging
    - world bank yet to back developing nations
  - three reactor restarts
    - TMI restarting with a power purchasing agreement from Microsoft
    - TMI called it the Crane Clean Energy center
    - What it will take to restart decommissioned US nuclear plants. Huff and Ryan
  - public opinion of nuclear power plants going up
    - PEW reports that since 2020, a majority of Americans are in favor of more nuclear going online
    - ADVANCE act
  - global carbon emissions are still increasing
    - only 0.1% growth in 2023
    - might turn around very soon
  - energy demand increases
    - we just want more power
    - data center companies will need a lot more energy
  - supply chain costs for clean energy
    - from the construction analytics, building cost index
    - construction is getting more expensive, but is kinda volatile
  - we abandoned a lot of reactors in the us in the 70s-80s
  - opinions on science
    - a lot of Americans say scientific investments are worthwhile
    - over half say it is important for the US to be a leader in nuclear energy
    - only about half say science has had a positive impact on society
  - transmission build-out is challenging
    - only 55 miles of high-voltage lines added in 2023
    - need millions of miles
    - lots of nuclear money frozen
  - reversals and re~reversals in nuclear policy
    - Donny is sending out orders and then rescinding them
    - disrupts so much stuff
    - hard to plan when everything is in disarray
    - Canada has the best U in the world, so the cost of fuel might jump 25%
