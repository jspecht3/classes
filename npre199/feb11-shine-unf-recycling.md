 # SHINE's scalable path to UNF Recycling

 # Ross Radel
 - went to UW-Madison
- did fusion for PhD and sandia for 8 years
- then went to work on space fusion

 # Shine
- market-driven approach to fusion
1. delivering low-yield fusion systems (DD & DT) for 10+ years
2. Producing medical isotopes
3. Applying lessions learned towards aqueous UNF recycling poliy facility and investigating fusion-enabled transmutation
4. scale up transmutation fusion drivers to surpass engineering break-even fusion yields
- Pheonix was the company that preceeded Shine
  - split because shine was focusing on phase 2
  - remerged during covid

 ## Phase 1: neturon imaging, testing, and detection
- imaging center operation since 2019
- delivered neutron generators to happy customers
- continued application development
  - cargo inspection
  - neutron CT
- they inspection of jet engine turbine blades to detect residual core material
- they image mission critical energetic devices
  - like ejection seats for planes
- DT neutron sources
- DT neutron irratiaiton services
  - they irradiate stuff for customers, they make a lot of neutrons
  - doing research to 10x the flux (same neutron count)
- using this to breed T from Li
- they are going crazy with the breeding

 ## Phase 2: therapeutic isotope production
 ### Lu-177
- cancer treatment isotope
- 1 week half-life
- natural Yb -> enriched Yb-176 -> neutron irradiation -> Lu-177 seperation and processing
- previously russia supplied enriched Yb, but now they make their own
 ### Mo-99
- produce enough Mo-99 to supply >50% of the US demand
1. irradiate aqueous LEU subcritical assembly w/ DT neutrons
2. up to 1 MW of fission produced and get ~6% Mo-99
3. transfer UO2SO4 to hold tanks and then the "super cell"

 ## Phase 3: used nuclear fuel (unf) recycling
- provide domestic RecU, MOX, and HALEU alternative
1. voloxidation for preprocessing
2. CoDCon extraction to create U/Pu blend
3. remove minor actinides
4. harvest platinum group metals and rare earth elements for sale
5. \>95% of wave volume expected to be suitable for near-surface disposal
- they want to make their pilot facility for UNF recycling
- US gov't does not like commercial recycling
- need to update the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
- want to convince the gov't to do this for energy independence
- need to show this is profitable
