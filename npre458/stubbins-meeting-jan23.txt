- problem with the MSRE is that they werent long term
- they have looked at various removal methods
- they did work at UIUC about bubbling with He to do load following
- the other issue is the DNPs having odd reactivties
- MSRE data is speculative
- argument about Xe hideout in graphite
- need to refine the whole thing
- we are just putting components in a place
- biggest issue w/ proliferation
- US requires that you extract U and Pu together
- check for Thorium and Protactinium policy
- we just don't want to be the ones that start reprocessing
- difference in reporcessing is mostly based on cost rn
- just worrking about the spent fuel later
- MSRE did not have a very good reactivity
- could look at designing a pump
- control of what you are doing in the salt is the most
- not take as much off the shelf technology
- savannah river T production reactors had issues with T
- at what temps can you get to with MSRs, above ~750-800*C is too hot
- operating ranges of the salts

- watts bar reactor makes T from a fuel cell replacement
- LANL accelerates protons to 800 MeV and spallates atoms to make T
- govt said we don't need that much T, we just need to have the threat that we can
- MIT Charles published papers about molten salt clean-up
- look at flow rates and processing rates
- look at if the medical isotopes are worth it
- MSU has a rare-isotope creation system we can look at for the isotope seperation
- Stubbins thinks this is going to be very hard to make MSRs work because it is so technologically complex
- Terrapower is looking at a chloride salt system
- solar towers use salt for energy storage

- we need to do something more complex than putting components in a flow line
