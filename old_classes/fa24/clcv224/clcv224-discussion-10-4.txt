In what ways are Medea and Katrina similar?

Medea and Katrina are both similar in the fact that they are both destructive
"women" who are extremely powerful. Medea is able to kill all of those that
stood before her in her homeland to help Jason escape. Katrina does not have
the same level of discresion in the sense that she killed people indiscriminantly.

Both women are also kind in the fact that Katrina may have taken a lot from
those who were affected by the storm, but many were left standing at the end
of it all. Similarly to Medea, she could have gone on a rampage in Corinth?
but chose to kill her kids and Jason's new wife instead. She could have razed
the city, but only killed 3 (4 indirectly people).

Both were extremely powerful, but merciful at the end of the day.
