        \question[50] What is the value of uranium utilization in LWRs, for a 
        once-through fuel cycle, if the fuel acheives a burnup of 45000 MWd/tU? 
        Assume enrichment of fuel is $3.2\%$ and tails are equal to $0.28\%$ 
        (Tsoulfanidis, 7.1).
        \begin{solution}
                solution here
