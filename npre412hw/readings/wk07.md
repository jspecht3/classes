# The Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Chapter 6 - In-Core Fuel Managment
- fuel management can refer to many things
  - broadly in core and out of core, talking about in core here
- operational constraints
  - reactivity the fuel to achieve scheduled burnup
  - adequate reactivity control
  - schedule refueling for periods of low demand
  - low fast neutron flux at pressure vessel (for PWRs)
- safety constraints
  - peak-to-avg power ratio
  - max core temp
  - DNBR
  - core reactivity
  - temp coefficient of reactivity
- Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA)
  - federal gov't said they would take the fuel away
  - they lied and did not take it away
- batch-wise refueling
- schedule outages 6 months before
