 # The Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Chapter 2 - Resources, Mining, and Milling

 ## Introduction
- U discovered in 1789 by Klaporthe who named it after the newest planet Uranus
- ore grades get up to 20%
- will present:
  1. methods for exploration
  1. mining methods and milling operations
  1. uranium reserves and resources
  1. economics
  1. Thorium

 ## Uranium Exploitation Techniques

 ### Geological Studies
- U forms in batholith and sedimentary rocks
- there are others too
- National Uranium Resource Evaluation divided the US into 612 areas for evaluation
  - phase 1: preliminary estimates
  - phase 2: more detailed estimates
- wanted to find more uranium and design new techniques for surveying and data collection

 ### Airborne Surveys
- either satellite or aircraft/helicopters
- shoot out em waves and receive reflected signal
- use NaI detectors for gamma-rays
- gives info about the presence of ore, but not quality or quantity
- used in the first phase of prospecting

 ### Surface Surveys
- on foot, horse-back, or an ATV

 ### Hydrochemical Methods
- analysis of water samples indicate if it has flown through U
- analyze the U/Pb ratio to form a geochemical "halo"

 ### Well Logging
- drill wells to explore surfaces in more detail
- probe measuring radioactivity is lowered into the hole
- might also measure He4 in the hole

 ### Botanical Methods
- many deep-rooted plants absorb and accumulate U
- plants are ashed and concentration recorded

 ## Principal U-Bearing Minerals
- nearly 100 species of U-bearing minerals have been identified
- oxides are black or brown
- phosphates are yellow
- torbernite is green

 ## Mining Methods
- open-pit: dig a big ass hole
- underground: strip mine like in minecraft
- in-situ leaching: dissolve rocks to get a slurry
- can also obtain U from other minerals
- can extract from seawater, but this is very costly rn

 ## Exploration and Mine Activities
- Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Niger, Russia, and US export >90% of global U

 ## Milling and Tails
- concentrated into yellow-cake
- ore crushed, ground into a powder, and roasted to remove organics
- waste material released into a tailings pond
- ponds need to hold the contents because they are radioactive

 ## Resources
- potential resource classifications
  - probable: in known production districts, but not quantified
  - possible: estimated to occur in undiscovered or partly defined deposits
  - speculative: educated guess
  - OECD used different classifications

 ## Production and Economics
- followed the trend of the nuclear industry
- price has had ups and downs as nuclear has

 ## Thorium
- 3x more abundant than U
- no demand for Th today, so compounds are a byproduct
- US has a lot of Th
