# The Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Chapter 4, Reactor Fuel Design and Fabrication
## reactor fuel and cladding materials
- U metal: reacts w/ most nonmetallic elements
- ceramic fuels: low thermal conductivity, high melting point
- MOX fuel: mixed oxide from reproccessing
- cladding: ZH
- burnable poisons
  - pyrex, wet annular burnable absorber, intergral fuel burnable absorber, Gd-U burnable poison
