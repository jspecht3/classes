 # The Uncertain Costs of New Nuclear Reactors: What Study Estimates Reveal about the Potential for Nuclear in a Decarbonizing World (2023)

 ## Executive Summary
- nuclear uncertain because of
  - policy enactment
  - public support
  - advanced reactors change investment equation
  - how fast competitors reduce costs
- few reactors have been built, especially newer designs -- not much data
- nuclear is more competitive in China and India because they can build stuff
- nuclear will play a marginal role, if any, if the cost does not get lower
- w/ 30% tax credit from the IRA, nuclear will be way cheaper
- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that lower reactor costs in emerging countries could result in nuclear being popular there
- when modeling wind & solar, the need for firm sources and storage options may be underestimated
  - omits costs associated w/ flexibility, market reserve, and storage that nuclear could fix

 ## Introduction
- models would work better if we knew more about
  - if policy for low-carbon tech will be enacted
  - public support
  - renewables
  - transmission siting
- most importantly, direct costs based on factors like
  - contractor mismanagement
  - specifications changing midstream to comply with regulations
  - not enough data
  - country to country costs differ wildly

 ## History of Cost Overruns for US Reactors
- leading reason for delays and extra costs are
  - declining labor productivity
  - labor supervision
  - from 1970-1990, construction time almost tripled
- before 2023, Watts Bar reactors were the latest to be built
  - 2x over budget and took 43 year to finish
- Vogtle was 2xx time and budget

 ## Reactor Builds outside the US
- first EPR cost 3x the initial estimate
- other reactor designs built in series and were much shorter (Japan, South Korea, China)
- construction time is used as a proxy for labor costs and remains a key variable affecting nuclear economics globally

 ## Additional Factors Affecting New Nuclear Reactor Deployment
- AP1000 costs in Georgia are ~15-20x the cost of alternative zero-carbon power
- renewables have been declining in cost per capacity
- renewables commonly have lower LCOE than nuclear electricity
  - not complete picture because of the soft nature of renewables
  - cost of energy storage not accounted for
- polluter pays policies
- policies to reduce air pollution and GHG emissions
  - no comprehensive economy-wide price for emitting GHGs
  - IRA w/ 30% tax credit
- reactor construction
  - economy of scale from gigantic reactors offset by longer construction times
  - keep the same workforce, South Korean APR1400 had 40% reduction in construction costs b/w units 1-4
- public support
  - a dozen states have laws restriction nuclear construction
  - need better spent fuel management
  - some renewables are encountering local opposition

 ## Estimated Reactor Costs for US and Select Nations
- NOAK costs after a few dozen reactors
- academic, governmental, and industrial estimates differ by over a factor of two

 ## Energy Systems Modeling
- many scenarios regarding nuclear techno-economic parameters are considered by the IPCC Working Group III and their database is online (AR6)
- generally, greater cost reduction of nuclear is seen in models more ambitious about decarbonization
- modeled 8 groups until 2100 from
  - best, Paris Agreement goals of <1.5*C increase are met w/ little overshoot
  - worst, global temp increases by >4*C
- costs for the IPCC range from 6k-4k/kW
- costs reductions in China and India decrease after the GDP/capita increases
- India projected to have the highest annual capacity additions across every scenario, time horizon, and emission reduction category (by a lot)
- Canada will have the lowest operating costs in almost all scenarios
- did not model solar being soft, which tends to overestimate renewables and underestimate nuclear
- more demand for nuclear in emerging and rapidly expanding economies

 ## Costs, Policies, and Competing Tech on Nuclear's Future
- New England doesn't like renewables because they don't have a good climate for them and would need a lot of storage capacity
- the lower the cost, the more nuclear is built
- EPRI convened 4 modeling teams (itself, NREL, EIA, US EPA) to
  - share methods and data
  - update models
  - run coordinated scenarios
  - identify research needs
- most nuclear w/
  - favorable policy
  - regional economic favorablity
  - lower cost and discount rates
  - stringent carbon limits
- less success w/
  - better low-emission tech
  - inability to deploy quickly
  - extensive load growth

 ## Conclusions
- may be a make-or-break period for the US
- other countries are better at deploying than us
- more nuclear in growing economies
- unclear how advanced reactors would change the game
