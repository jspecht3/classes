# The Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Chapter 5 - Reactor Physics Calculations
- rho = (k - 1)/k
- Xe135 and Sm149 are poisons
- goes over transport and diffusion
- multi-group diffusion approximation formalism
- already took 455, so nothing interesting
- Monte Carlo codes
  - KENO, MORSE, MCNP, TRIPOLI, FLUKA
- nuclear data
  - ENDF/B: decay constant, decay type, cross-section, resonance parameters, fission yields, secondary neutron energy and angular distribution, (gamma, n) rxns
  - NJOY
- self-shielding: flux is lower than expected due to resonance
  - spatial and energy
