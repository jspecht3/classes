- DOE. Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Advanced Nuclear
	- data center growth is causing demand in nuclear
	- need an additional ~700-900 GW of 1300 GW total capacity to reach net zero carbon 
	- of the existing 94 reactors, 84 have licenses that will expire prior to 2050, 24 before 2035
	- need to have the next wave of nuclear reactors be on-time and on-budget
	- barriers to liftoff
		- market power prices do not compensate nuclear for the value it provides
		- potential customers cite cost or cost overrun risk as the primary barrier
		- US lacks nuclear and mega-project delivery infrastructure

- EIA. Annual Energy Outlook 2023. Technical Report AEO2023
	- administrator's foreword
		- mainly about ranges and trends and not predictions and point estimates due to uncertainty
		- only considering current laws and regulations across all cases
	- executive summary
		- biggest change since last year was the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
		- predicted reduction in CO2 emissions by 25% to 38% below 2005 levels. the Paris Agreement called for 50-52% reduction b/w 2005 and 2030
		- low projected CO2 emissions driven by increased electrification, equipment efficiency, and renewable technologies for electricity generation
		- limited emissions due to longer-term growth of transportation and industrial activity
		- once built, wind and solar are the least cost resources to operate as they have no fuel requirements
			- yea, but the wind turbines need to be oiled every 9-16 months and have their gearbox changed ~10 years when designed for 20
		- solar generation to go from 325% in 2022 -> 1019% now by 2050
		- wind generation to go from 138% in 2022 -> 235% now by 2050
		- natural gas generation will also increase ranging from 20% to 87% though 2050
		- more heat pumps, electric vehicles for consumers. more arc furnaces for iron and steel industries
		- for transportation, increasing travel overcomes increasing efficiency
		- continued growth in US petroleum production
	- Introduction
		- COVID and Russia invading Ukraine may cause volatility in the markets
		- energy related CO2 emissions fall b/w 25% to 38% below 2005 levels by 2030
			- 25% with high economic growth and high zero-carbon technology costs
			- 38% with low economic growth and low zero-carbon technology costs
			- electric power emissions are responsive to the cost of zero-carbon technologies
			- transportation emissions are sensitive to the cost of fossil fuels
	- Section 1: the electricity mix in the US shifts from fossil fuels to renewables
		- renewable are displacing fossil fuels in electric power due to declining renewable technology costs and rising subsidies for renewable power
		- natural gas demand stabilizes across all cases
		- wind and solar out-compete other systems because of no fuel costs
			- what about maintenance for wind
		- more batteries to fix renewable's load following issue
		- sharp decline in coal to 50% of 2005 by 2030
	- Section 2: technological advancements and electrification decrease demand-side energy intensity
		- demand-side energy intensity, the measure of energy consumed per household or per square ft of commercial space, decreased due to improved efficiency: technology, policy, consumer behavior, demographics, and fuel mix
		- energy consumption increases through 2050
		- greater heating equipment efficiency reduces fossil fuel use in buildings
		- b/c of warmer winters and summers, lower energy used on heating and more used on cooling
		- electric heat pumps are slow on the uptake because
			- non-heat pump equipment that lasts a long time
			- high cost of switching
			- higher price of electricity despite heat pump efficiency being higher
			- reduced demand for space heating as efficiency improves
		- CO2 produced by making iron and steel decrease as more electric arc-furnaces are used
		- arc-furnaces make up 68% of US steel production
	- Section 3: international demand for petroleum and natural gas drives us production, while domestic consumption either grows slowly or decreases
		- US to remain a net exporter of petroleum products through 2050
		- international demand for finished petroleum products keeps US refineries running strong
		- natural gas is variable. grows if there is a high oil supply and shrinks if there is a low oil supply
		- historically, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil were price-linked under contracts. recently, more LNG causes this relation to erode
		- shale gas and associated dissolved natural gas from oil formations are the primary sources of long-term growth of domestic natural gas production through 2050
	- Discussion
		- energy markets are inherently uncertain because of policy, technology, demographics, and resources

- Modeling Advanced Nuclear Energy Technologies: Gaps and Opportunities
	- lots of hope to get to net-zero carbon by 2050
		- 12 states passed legislation to fully decarbonize by 2050
		- Biden set that target for the US
	- lack of tools that can simulate the capabilities of advanced nuclear reactors (ANR)
	- 3 big takeaways
		- capital cost is perhaps the most important modeling parameter
		- diversifying the types of advanced reactor designs with energy services and flexibilities advanced nuclear provides can improve projected economics
		- modelers indicated they would update their cost if better data were available
	- 2/10 models simulated MSRs and HTGRs
	- 5/10 modelers assumed ANRs can provide one or more of...
		- industrial processes and heat
		- combined heat and power
		- hydrogen production
		- water desalination
		- synthetic fuels production
		- marine propulsion
		- replacement of coal-fired boilers
	- most developers are designing supply for one or more of these services
	- n-th of a kind (NOAK) are almost half of first of a kind (FOAK) capital costs for SMRs
		- $2000/kWe compared to $3800/kWe
		- these numbers are kinda iffy
	- they recommend
		- establishing an ANR cost and performance database to track the latest information
		- DOE office or national lab w/ expertise in ANR tech should make this database
		- reps from the org should meet with reps from NREL to get the data inputs and how this data will be collected/generated
		- establish a "robust" database development process
		- ensure the database considers the potential system benefits and markets for ANRs
		- in the development interim, use the data from this survey

- Nuclear Costs in Context. Nuclear Energy Institute
	- generating cost for nuclear was 40% lower in 2022 than in 2012 due to decrease in fuel costs, capital expenditures, and operating costs
	- cost associated with risk must be covered
	- most plants get extended as they replace their vessel heads, steam generations, and other upgrades
	- capital costs increased after 9/11 and Fukushima to prevent disasters like them
	- operating costs have fallen since 2012
	- fuel is ~17% of the generating cost and the price had decreased since 2013
	- since 2014, all quartiles of generating costs have steadily decreased

		- Breeder Reactor Fuel Cycle is a closed cycle producing enough new fuel to be self sufficient after a few years

- The Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Chapter 8
	- economic terms
		- capital obtained from private investors, lending agencies, endowment funds, and banks
		- over-engineered projects cannot compete in the free market
		- companies obligated to pay bondholders before shareholders
		- net earnings = gross revenues - operating expenses - state and local taxes - depreciation - interest paid to bondholders
		- taxes calculated by the assessed value of a company. either based on initial cost or current replacement cost
		- depreciation
			- straight-line depreciation
				- the equipment loses a constant fraction of its value over the lifetime until it has no value
				- simplest method of depreciation
			- sum-of-the-year's digits
				- asset depreciates faster during the early years of life
			- double declining balance
				- also decreases faster
		- the time value or present worth of money
			- money changes value over time

			- amortization, pay equal payments to repay the principal plus interest
			- repay the principal with N equal payments and pay the interest of the unpaid balance at the end of each year
	- electric utility as a business
		- utilities are monopolies, but
			- operate in the regulatory constraints of the government
			- expand to meet the growth of its service area
			- keep developing technology in their field to provide a cost reduction to customers
		- why was AT&T broken up? it was doing all of the above things ^^^
		- utilities are allowed to operate with a high debt-to-equity ratio because of their financial stability
		- low profit margin and they cannot keep many profits
		- ratio of net worth to revenues
			- manufacturing companies < 1
			- electric utility ~3
		- costs for electric utility
			- 60% generation
			- 10% transmission
			- distribution
		-  preferred stock owners have a lower dividend yield, but get paid before common stock holders
		- Public Utility Regulatory Polity Act (PURPA) 1978
			- required utilities to buy power from non-utility generation (NUG) facilities that use renewables or cogeneration
			- tried to stimulate the use of renewable energy
			- utilities had to buy even if they didn't need the energy or if it was more expensive than market
			- PURPA cost many utilities and customers money
		- Energy Policy Act 1992
			- broadened exemptions from certain regulations for more NUGs
			- increased NUG generating capacity
			- let NUGs have open access to their transmission lines stipulating that access is at comparable to what they charge
			- opened gates to competition for the sale of electricity
			- EPACT 05 and EISA 07 were amendments to PURPA
		- deregulated so utilities carry the risk of investment
		- two new trends currently
			- separation of plant construction and generation of electricity
			- diversification of utility financial activities into areas unrelated to electricity
		- utilities are obligated to satisfy energy demands at all times
		- utilities try to reduce the ratio of peak-to-average demand
	- special feature of nuclear fuel and cost components for nuclear electricity
		- turn-over rate of fossil fuels is short, but nuclear is very long
		- gov't charges utilities a tax for nuclear energy for eventual disposal
		- fuel is considered an asset at the beginning that declines as it burns up
		- novel design is 20% of the cost of a nuclear plant's construction! wtf?
		- fuel is ~30% of the generating costs
		- regulation is counted as O&M costs
	- calculating the cost of electricity
		- calculating the cost of producing electricity
			- $e = 10^3 \cdot \frac{xI + O\&M + F}{E}$
			- e = unit cost of electricity
			- x = annual fixed change rate
			- I = initial plant cost
			- O&M = annual operating and maintenance costs
			- F = annual fuel cost
			- E = net electricity generated
		- levelized cost of electricity
			- attempts to give an average cost of electricity for average financial conditions
			- cost based on
				- federal policies
				- local policies
				- type of power plant
				- method of utility financing
			- calculated assuming the utility makes just enough to
				- pay required return to investors
				- pay all taxes
				- reduce the net investment in the batch by an amount that allows the net investment to go to zero once the last cash flow pertaining to the batch has occurred
			- calculating this is gnarly
			- assumes
				- all cash flow occurs at the end of the period in which they appear
				- return to investors is paid at the same frequency as taxes
				- tax effects are felt simultaneously with the transaction
		- discount rate is the effective cost of money
	- comparison of electricity from different plants
		- don't really know if nuclear is economical because of how few reactors have been built recently
		- cost of nuclear fuel has not increased much since 1984 (130/kg -> 150/kg)
		- external costs are hard to account for
			- environmental pollution
			- public deaths
			- degradation of the environment
		- uncertainty around potential costs is smaller for nuclear than another other electricity generation method
