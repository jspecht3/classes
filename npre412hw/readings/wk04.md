 # The Nuclear Fuel Cycle: Chapter 3 - Conversion and Enrichment

 ## Intro
- US built enrichment for bombs then for subs, reactors
- Canada uses natural enrichment
- main operating cost of enrichment is the power for the compressors to move UF6

 ## Fuel Fabrication
1. purifying U3O8
1. convering U3O8 to UF6
1. enrichment by gaseous diffusion
   1. seperability based on the sqrt of the mass ratio
   1. lots of strippers that feed into each other
1. fuel and tails are converted back into UO2 for storage

 ## US Enrichment Corportation (USEC)
- energy policy act of 1992 established USEC to provide enrichment services
- publicly traded on the stock exchange

 ## Weapons U for Civilian Fuel
- US and USSR did megatons to megawatts to de-escalate
- we down blend weapons grade material into fuel

 ## Centrifuge Enrichment
- we almost had one of these, but Reagan killed it
- spin UF6 until the heavy stuff went to the outside

 ## Seperation Nozzle
- feed UF6 and H2 into a meth channel w/ two openings
  - lower parallel to ground opening for heavy UF6
  - higher opening parallel to channel for light UF6
- no incentive to develop this tech as we have better methods

 ## Laser Enrichment
- US abandoned the centrifuge in favor os atomic vapor laser isotope seperation (AVLIS) for our sole advanced enrichment method
- have not upgraded to large scale production because we need better lasers
1. pool of liquid U forgmed at the bottom of a chamber and vapor is emitted
1. beam of U exposed to laser light of 5915 Ang exciting U235
1. uv light kicks excited electrons and ionized U235
1. attract ions w/ faraday cup
- low throughput and high temps are required
- almost complete separation and low energy consumption
- molecular isotope separation is another method similar to this
- SILEX is another method under development

 ## Costs and Contracts
- two contracts offered by USEC
  - requirements: obligates supplier to provide services when they are needed. supplier receives benefits and assums the risk of demand reduction
  - utility: 30 year term, but customers could cancel given a 10-year notice.

 ## Capacity
- most of the world operates a once-trough fuel cycle
- we need constant enrichment because we don't recycle
- enrichment capacity is changing all the time
