        \question[50] What is the savings in natural uranium if both uranium 
        and plutonium are recycled in LWRs, assuming the following 
        (Tsoulfanidis, 7.3): 
        \begin{itemize}
                \item $3\%$ enriched fuel 
                \item with $0.22\%$ tails
                \item $0.78\%$ $^{235}U$ in spent fuel
                \item $6.9\frac{gfPu}{kg_{SNF}}$
                \item $0.90\frac{kg_{recovered}}{kg_{fresh}}$
                \item 0.8 Pu-$^{235}U$ equivalence.
        \end{itemize}
